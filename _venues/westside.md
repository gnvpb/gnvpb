Westside Park has three outdoor courts on the east side of the Joyce Oransky Tennis Center outside the fence. The courts are in a shared space commonly used by tennis players who like to practice against the side wall of the adjacent racquet ball courts. Please be respectful of the shared space. The courts cannot be reserved. No nets are available for checkout at this time.
