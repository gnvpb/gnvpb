Gainesville Pickleball is working with the county to modify the hockey rink at Kanapaha Veterans Memorial Park for use as a pickleball venue. The large paved area and perimeter wall provide an ideal space for pickleball. The plan is for 6 courts, oriented North-South with secure space to store portable nets on site.
