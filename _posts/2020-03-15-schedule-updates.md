As we embrace social distancing, Pickleball is moving outdoors for a bit. There is no play at [MLK](/venues/mlk/) until 3/29/2020 and [Westside Baptist Church](/venues/westside_baptist/) is closed for 2 weeks.

There will be outdoor play for those interested at [JTC](/venues/jtc/) and [Hal Brady](/venues/halbrady/) in Alachua on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday mornings. The [300 Club](/venues/300/) is temporarily adding play time on Monday and Wednesday 11:30-1:30. The 300 Club still has the usual M/W/F at 6:30pm and Sunday at 2pm as well.
