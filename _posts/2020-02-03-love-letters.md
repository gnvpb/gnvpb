Gainesville Pickleball's own Kevin Rainsberger and his wife Nell Page will take the stage to perform “Love Letters” by A.R. Gurney, on the Hippodrome Mainstage Monday, February 10 at 7 p.m. Come to support Kevin and Nell and raise funds for the GO2 Foundation for Lung Cancer. All proceeds from this event will benefit the G02 Foundation.

In LOVE LETTERS, Andrew (Kevin Rainsberger) and Melissa (Nell Page) share the details of their separate lives through the course of about 50 years of intimate cards, notes and letters.  What began as birthday thank-you notes and summer camp postcards somersaults into a decades-long correspondence that beautifully tracks the characters as they each go to college, get married and have children.
