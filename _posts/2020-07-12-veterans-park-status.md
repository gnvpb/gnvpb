Our fearless leader, John Petrich, is working with the county to get the hockey rink at Kanapaha Veterans Memorial Park converted for use as a pickleball venue. The plan is approved and the work is underway. The court has already been pressure washed in preparation for painting. 

All this work does not happen for free though. Gainesville Pickleball is still seeking funding to cover the costs of pressure washing, line painting, 6 nets, and secure storage for those nets. If you are able, please support this effort to  create the first public courts in southwest Gainesville. Gainesville Pickleball is a 501c3 non-profit so any contributions are tax deductable. Please make checks payable to _Gainesville Pickleball Corporation_. You can send your contributions to
